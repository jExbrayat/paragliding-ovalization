# Legend

$O$: origin from which we begin to look at a thermal particle and the paraglider pilot  

$P$: pilot's position after making one turn  

$T$: thermal particle's position after the pilot made one turn  

$(OT)$: pilot's trajectory  

$(OP)$: thermal particle's trajectory. Considered as the optimal trajectory for climbing  

$\vec{OP}$: vector of the pilot's movement  

$\vec{OT}$: vector of the thermal particle's movement

$\vec{Dv}$: horizontal component of $\vec{OP}$ and $\vec{OT}$ due to the wind drift  
$||\vec{Dv}|| =$ *wind speed * time for one turn*

$\vec{Vzt}$: vertical component of $\vec{OT}$  
$||\vec{Vzp}|| =$ *thermal climb rate * time for one turn*  

$\vec{Vzp}$: vertical component of $\vec{OP}$  
$||\vec{Vzp}|| =$ *(thermal climb rate - pilot sink rate) * time for one turn*  

$I$: point of intersection between the pilot's ovalization trajectory $(IP)$ and the optimal placement in the thermal  

$\vec{i}$: vector of the pilot's ovalization movement
