$O$: origin from which we begin to look at a thermal particle and the paraglider pilot  

$P$: pilot's position after making one turn  

$T$: thermal particle's position after the pilot made one turn  

$(Tp)$: pilot's trajectory

$(Tt)$: thermal particle's trajectory  

$\vec{OP}$: vector of pilot's movement  

$\vec{OT}$: vector of thermal particle's movement

$\vec{Dv}$: horizontal component of $\vec{OP}$ and $\vec{OT}$ due to the wind drift  

$\vec{Vzp}$: vertical component of $\vec{OP}$ due to the vertical speed of the pilot  
$||\vec{Vzp}|| =$ *pilot's vertical speed * time for one turn*  

$\vec{Vzt}$: vertical component of $\vec{OT}$ due to the vertical speed of the thermal  
$||\vec{Vzp}|| =$ *thermal's vertical speed * time for one turn*
